	<p>the majority of art/sound/code was created by myself during the jam period, although i used CC0 resources like <a href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound</a> and <a href="https://godotshaders.com/">Godot shaders</a>. some assets were created before the jam period (by myself).</p>
	<p>this game was heavily inspired by yume nikki (the source of the character "mado"), hylics, and lisa: the painful, so check those out too!</p>
	<p>you can find the game's source code and assets on its open-source <a href="https://github.com/kiwijuice56/low-rez-jam-2024">repository</a>. thank you for playing!</p>
